{"name":"Mobile-survey","tagline":"","body":"Appirio built a Mobile-Survey tool to demonstrate how easy it is to deploy a full web-app using the Heroku platform.\r\n\r\nMobile-Survey allows users to login and take surveys from mobile devices as well as from desktop browsers.\r\n\r\nThe web-app has 3 major components: \r\n1. Heroku services (including Postgres, Heroku Connect, and Papertrail addons)\r\n2. Frontend web app\r\n3. Salesforce backend\r\n\r\nSurveys are built in Salesforce.  Salesforce data is synchronized bi-directionally with Postgres DB using Heroku Connect.  Restful web services transmit survey data between Postgres and the web-app. \r\n\r\nDeploy the full web-app here: \r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Appirio/Mobile-Survey/tree/master\">\r\n![image deploy button]\r\n(https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)\r\n\r\nDetailed Setup and Walkthrough instructions are here:","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
